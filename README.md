# Infra-Lens

A professional, modular GitHub Action that automatically summarizes infrastructure changes using AI (OpenAI API), making infrastructure changes easier to understand for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.


# Background

My general goal is to make complex things as simple as possible — so here we go.

Sometimes you just need simple words and short sentences to explain what’s happening during AWS CDK diffs before deployment — especially when many commits or unexpected API updates unanticipated changes.

This project grew out of my journey learning of AWS, IaC, and CloudFormation — and the realization that certain changes (like updates to deprecated APIs) can unexpectedly break your cloud stack. It’s designed as an add-on to your workflow, helping anyone — even with limited time or technical background — quickly understand infrastructure changes to your cloud. Is aims at helping you in easly analysing what's going on.

## Infrastructure Changes Summary

### New Resources Being Created
- **S3 Bucket (MyBucket)**: A new storage bucket for application data
